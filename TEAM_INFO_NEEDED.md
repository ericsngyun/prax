## **Current Placeholder Philosophy Quotes:**

These are well-written but may not match what each person would actually say. Please provide actual quotes from each team member if possible:

**Jack:** "Precision is not about perfection—it is about intention. Every cut should be designed to maintain structure as it grows. That is the standard."

**Gavin:** "A fade is not just a gradient—it is architecture. Every line must flow with intention. The details separate the good from the exceptional."

**Edward:** "Hair has memory. Understanding how it moves, falls, and grows is what allows us to design cuts that work beyond the chair."

**Steven:** "Color is not decoration—it is dimension. When done with discipline, it enhances structure and brings depth to the design."

**Timeline:** Provide this info whenever ready - the website is functional with placeholders, but accurate details will make it more authentic and credible.
